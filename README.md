## Special Thanks
Thank you joesinghaus for their [Blades template] (https://github.com/joesinghaus/Blades-template). This sheet is what inspired me and laid the foundation for this Life After Character Sheet.


Thank you clevett for their [simple character sheet template] (https://github.com/clevett/roll20-SheetTemplate) for making a basic version for me to build off of for a simple draft.
